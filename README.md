## Introduction

A library providing alternative syntax on top of [Clara Rules](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules). After deep contemplation, thorough discussion with the greatest minds I know, and summoning the willpower of a Greek god, I decided to resist calling it O'Doyle Rules. You are welcome.

## Development

* Install [the Clojure CLI tool](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools)
* To develop on each OS:
  * `clj -A:dev:linux native`
  * `clj -A:dev:macos native`
  * `clj -A:dev:windows native`
* To run the tests: `clj -A:test`
* To install the release version: `clj -A:prod install`
