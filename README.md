## Introduction

A library providing an alternative syntax for [Clara Rules](https://github.com/cerner/clara-rules). After deep contemplation, thorough discussion with the greatest minds I know, and summoning the willpower of a Greek god, I decided to resist calling it O'Doyle Rules. You are welcome.

## Usage

You can include this library in your project dependencies using the version number in the badge above.

## Development

* Install [the Clojure CLI tool](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools)
* To run the tests: `clj -A:test`
* To install the release version: `clj -A:prod install`

## Licensing
